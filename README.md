This repo provides exponential and log maps for special orthogonal groups (SO3) and special Euclidian groups (SE3).

## Special Orthogonal Group (SO3)

Rotation matrix is SO3.

Quick and intuitively, the rotation matrix is nonlinear. For more, refer Chapter2. 
### Exponential Mapping 
As R is in nonlinear space, instantaneous rotation is not dR. Rather, the instantaneous rotation is more like the information from the gyroscope in x, y, and z axes. This 3D vecotr need to be mapped as a matrix. The mapping from 3D vector to the rotation matrix is exponential mapping.


### Logarithmic Mapping
The inverse mapping of exponential mapping. The log maps the rotation matrix to 3D vector.
